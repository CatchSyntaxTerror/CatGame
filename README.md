A cozy HTML5 canvas game made with JavaScript and pixel love.  
Catch fish, dodge trash, and enjoy lively animations — all packed into a single file for max shareability.

## 🎮 Overview

This game uses a multi-canvas layout:
- **Main canvas**: the game world with falling fish and an animated cat sprite
- **Right panel**: guide showing fish types, point values, and remaining lives
- **Left panel**: control hints, goal reminders, and live score display

## 🧰 Features

- Catchable fish with varying point values  
- Hazards (lures, rusty cans) that reduce lives  
- Score and lives tracker  
- Keyboard movement with idle + lick animations  
- Sprite animation system (lick, idle, run)  
- Dynamic UI panels rendered with canvas  
- Difficulty scaling — fish fall faster and spawn more frequently as you succeed  
- Game Over screen with a “Play Again” button
