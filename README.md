# 🐱 Cat Game

This project is a JavaScript-based animation built using the HTML5 Canvas API.  
It was designed as a learning exercise in procedural animation, sprite management, and canvas layout.  
The main feature is a cat character that responds to keyboard input and performs different animations depending on its movement and state.

---

## 🧵 Overview

The layout includes three canvas elements:
- 🎯 A central canvas (`canvas1`) where the main game and animation logic takes place.
- 🧩 Two side panels (`canvas2` and `canvas3`) intended for UI elements or additional interactions.

The game is displayed in a fixed-size layout, with all canvases aligned horizontally and centered on the screen.  
This ensures consistent behavior and appearance across different devices and screen resolutions.

## ✨ Features

- 🕹️ Smooth sprite-based animations controlled by keyboard input  
- 🌀 Procedural animation states: `"idle"`, `"lick"`, `"runLeft"`, `"runRight"`  
- 📐 Responsive and centered layout using CSS Flexbox  
- 🎞️ Background rendering and frame-based animation timing

## 🎮 Controls

- ⬅️ ➡️ Arrow keys or `A` / `D` can be used to move the cat left or right.  
- 🎲 On key release, the cat randomly selects between idle and licking animations.
