# 🐱 Cat Catcher

A cute HTML5 canvas game made with JavaScript and pixel love.  
Catch fish, dodge trash, and enjoy lively animations all in one cozy file — so even your least tech-savvy friends can play!

## 🧵 Overview

This game features a multi-canvas layout:
- 🎮 **Main canvas**: the game world with falling fish and animated cat sprite
