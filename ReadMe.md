#  Cat Game

A simple browser game I created to practice JavaScript.  
It uses **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and the **Canvas API**.

The goal is to keep it easy for friends who aren’t tech-savvy—just open `index.html` and play!

##  What’s Done So Far

- Basic project setup:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `main.js`

 - Character animations

- User input handling

---

##  What’s Coming Next

- A background scene
- Fish falling from the sky for the player to catch and score points
- A controls panel to explain how to play

---

## How to Play

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the cat!

## Why One JavaScript File?

 - To avoid the need for a live server
